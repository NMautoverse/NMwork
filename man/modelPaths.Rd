model.}
\usage{
modelPaths(file, as.dt = TRUE, must.exist = FALSE, simplify = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{path to control stream, or almost any other model file}

\item{as.dt}{Return model information in a data.table?}

\item{must.exist}{Make sure the provided paths match files?
Default is not to but it can be a good first check in a
script.}

\item{simplify}{If only one model supplied, and `as.dt=FALSE`,
should the format be simplified to a list of model elements,
rather than a list of (model) lists of elements?}
